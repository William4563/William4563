- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @William4563
Hope you are doing great.
We provide Takeoff services.

We do estimates of all types of construction projects like commercial and residential.

We have expertise in all trades like Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC, and so on.

All you need to do is just send us the drawings via email or dropbox and we will get back to you with our services fee proposal and turnaround time shortly. If you approve of the proposal we will start working on your estimate.
You can ask for our sample take-offs & estimates to get a better idea of our work. Thanks.

Best Regards,
